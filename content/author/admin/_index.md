I am a PhD student in Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging at the University of York, UK. I am interested in the functional hierachy of the human brain, the neural trait-state interactions, and their associations with behaviour and unconstrained ongoing experience. I am part of the Mind-Wandering lab led by Prof. Jonny Smallwood at the department of Psychology in the University of York, UK.
