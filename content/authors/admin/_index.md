I am a postdoctoral research associate at the University of York, UK, working on a collaborative neuroimaging project funded by the [York Maastricht Partnership](https://www.york.ac.uk/maastricht), with Profs [Antony Morland](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academicstaff/arm501) and [Alex Wade](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academicstaff/alex-wade) ([YNiC](https://www.ynic.york.ac.uk/)), and Profs [Elia Formisano](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/e.formisano) and [Rainer Goebel](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/r.goebel) ([M-BIC](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/maastricht-brain-imaging-centre)). I have a PhD in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging and I am interested in the functional hierarchy of the human brain, information flow, neural trait-state interactions, as well as their associations with behaviour and ongoing experience.

Born in [Veria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veria), Greece, I received my bachelor's degree in physics from the department of [Physics](https://www.physics.auth.gr/en) at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. Following several years of physics tutoring in Greece, I changed my career path and moved to the UK, where I obtained my master's degree in cognitive neuroscience at the department of [Psychology](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology) at the University of York, under the supervision of Prof. [Gary Green](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/emeritusfaculty/ggrg1).

Upon graduating my master's programme, I worked as a research assistant in Prof. [Jonathan Smallwood](https://www.queensu.ca/psychology/jonathan-smallwood)'s lab at the University of York. A year later, I was awarded a studentship for a PhD under the joint supervision of Prof. Smallwood and Prof. [Elizabeth Jefferies](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academicstaff/ej514), from the department of Psychology at the University of York. After a 5-month break in my 2nd PhD year, in order to work on a pilot neuroimaging study investigating experiences in virtual/augmented reality led by Prof. Alex Wade, I completed my PhD and joined Prof. Smallwood's lab in York as a research associate for 19 months until I started my current post.

My PhD [thesis](http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/25062/) investigated the neural correlates of ongoing experience. We utilised different neuroimaging modalities (DWI, resting state fMRI) and analysis techniques (static connectivity and dynamic hidden Markov modelling) in order to explore how the structural and functional organisation of the brain at different temporal scales can help us identify the cognitive processes that support different types of unconstrained ongoing experience at different moments in time.

The main aim of our current research project is to bring together two neuroimaging research techniques, Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and ultra high-field fMRI, in order to explore the functional hierarchy of the human brain, and answer novel questions on how information flows through the brain during perception and cognition.
