I am an Assistant Professor at the [School of Psychology](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/schools/psychology/), University of Sussex. My research investigates how large-scale brain dynamics support ongoing thoughts, with a focus on functional brain hierarchy, neural information flow, attractor states, and trait–state interactions. I am particularly interested in how these mechanisms relate to everyday experience, learning, and dispositional traits, as well as their relevance for mental health.

My lab combines multimodal neuroimaging (structural, functional, diffusion MRI, E/MEG) with behavioural testing and computational modelling. We use both static and dynamic analysis approaches, including machine learning methods, to characterise how patterns of brain activity unfold over time and shape conscious experience.

Originally from [Veria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veria), Greece, I studied physics at the [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.physics.auth.gr/en) before moving to the UK to pursue an MSc in cognitive neuroscience at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology). I subsequently worked as a research assistant in Prof. [Jonathan Smallwood](https://www.queensu.ca/psychology/people/jonathan-smallwood)’s lab before being awarded a studentship for a PhD under the joint supervision of Prof. Smallwood and Prof. [Elizabeth Jefferies](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academicstaff/ej514). During my PhD, I also contributed to a pilot neuroimaging study on immersive experiences led by Prof. [Alex Wade](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academicstaff/alex-wade). I then held two postdoctoral positions: one in Prof. Smallwood’s lab, and a second within a collaborative neuroimaging project funded by the [York–Maastricht Partnership](https://www.york.ac.uk/maastricht), working with colleagues at [YNiC](https://www.ynic.york.ac.uk/) and [M-BIC](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/maastricht-brain-imaging-centre).

At Sussex, I lead a research lab working with brilliant placement students, PhD, and early career researchers (ECRs), aiming to advance theoretical and empirical models of brain–behaviour relationships, particularly in relation to the stability and flexibility of dynamic cognitive states across time and context. I also supervise undergraduate, MSc, and PhD projects, and convene and teach modules in programming and cognitive neuroscience at both undergraduate and postgraduate level.
