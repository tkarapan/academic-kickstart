abstract = {Sleep problems and intrusive memories play an important role in the onset and maintenance of many mental health disorders. Here, we show that depriving healthy participants of sleep disrupts their ability to keep intrusive memories at bay. Using functional neuroimaging, we reveal that these deficits are related to difficulties in engaging brain regions that support the inhibition of memory retrieval. These findings offer fresh insight into our understanding of the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying the link between poor sleep and mental illness and could support the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies. Sleep disturbances are associated with intrusive memories, but the neurocognitive mechanisms underpinning this relationship are poorly understood. Here, we show that sleep deprivation disrupts prefrontal inhibition of memory retrieval, and that the overnight restoration of this inhibitory mechanism is associated with time spent in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The functional impairments arising from sleep deprivation are linked to a behavioral deficit in the ability to downregulate unwanted memories, and coincide with a deterioration of deliberate patterns of self-generated thought. We conclude that sleep deprivation gives rise to intrusive memories via the disruption of neural circuits governing mnemonic inhibitory control, which may rely on REM sleep.}}
