abstract = "Contemporary views of brain function emphasise that neural processing is organised along multiple macro-scale hierarchies that describe the relationship between large-scale networks. Examples include the organisation of networks on a continuum from unimodal to transmodal function, as well as the characteristic response of the brain to tasks. Our study examines the possibility that these hierarchies represent a functional landscape that describes how organised states of neural activity emerge. To address this possibility, we applied machine learning to recordings of task-free neural data to identify the distribution of naturally occurring network states at rest. We examined the distribution of these states in a lower dimensional space reflecting three well-described neurocognitive hierarchies (unimodal-transmodal, visual-sensorimotor and task positive). We found spontaneous neural states were generally absent from the centre of this lower dimensional space, and instead were located at the extreme ends of one or more hierarchies. Furthermore, states most discriminative of participants’ experience at rest were not well-described by hierarchies reflecting the unimodal-transmodal architecture of the brain, and instead reflected both extremes of a hierarchy describing how the brain responds to task demands. Our analyses demonstrate that neural hierarchies provide a flexible co-ordinate space to understand the hidden dynamics of unconstrained thought and highlight that neurocognitive states characteristic of the brain’s response to task demands capture important aspects of our self-generated mental lives during wakeful rest."
