abstract = "Experience is not always tied to events taking place in the environment. We often generate thoughts, images and feelings unrelated to the events in the here and now. Important aspects of these self-generated experiences are stable over time within an individual but are also associated with various dispositional traits (such as ADHD or depression). In our current study, we explored whether task free functional imaging can shed light on whether these associated dispositional features depend on common or distinct underlying mechanisms. We acquired resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a large cohort of participants and sampled their experience during the scan by asking them to retrospectively report their thoughts. In a separate experimental session, participants completed a battery of measures reflecting a range of different dispositional traits. Independent component analysis identified a set of whole-brain functional networks, and we modelled how the associations between each of these nodes correlated with metrics of ongoing thought at rest as well as with dispositional indices of physical and mental health. Behaviourally, we found evidence of association between patterns of ongoing experience emphasising visual imagery and aspects of disposition that reflected high levels of self-consciousness, depression and attentional problems. We found that increased connectivity between a posterior parietal network and a lateral fronto-temporal network was associated with more reports of visual imagery at rest. Furthermore, a pattern of decoupling between the brainstem and a lateral visual network was associated with dispositional internal focus (elevated self-consciousness, rumination and attentional problems). Critically, we found that these two brain-cognition relationships were related: the correlation between parietal frontal regions and reports of visual imagery was stronger for individuals who also had stronger connectivity between aspects of the brain stem and cerebellum with visual cortex. Together, these results suggest that unique patterns of neural organisation reflect trait variance both in ongoing patterns of thought at rest and associated dispositional traits. Furthermore, our results suggest that accounting for trait-like dispositional patterns associated with different patterns of ongoing experience is important when exploring the neural mechanisms supporting different elements of self-generated experience."
